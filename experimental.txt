RACLETS campaign
* Took place February and March 2019 in the Davos region in the Swiss Alps.
* Objective was to investigate the pathway of precipitation formation, covering the entire aerosol-cloud-precipitation-snow distribution chain.
* Multiple set of instruments and measurements was deployed

Measurement location
* The Alpine massif is oriented in a southwest-northeast direction and reaches up to 3000m or 2400m above the surrounding lowlands.
* Weather systems predominantly approach from northwest or south. However, in our case study from north.
* Three mountain-top sations (WFJ 2700m, Gotschnagrat 2300m) and three valley stations (WOP 1600m, Laret 1500m, Klosters 1200m). All within a distance of 10km.
    
Measurements being used in this study
* HoloGondel
* Snowdriftstation
* Radiosoundings Stuttgart and Munich
* Holfuy station Gotschnagrat
* INP measurements at WFJ and WOP
* Ceilometer and weather station in Klosters
* Remote sensing WOP
    
HoloGondel
* HOLIMO
* OPC
* GPS
* Temp and RH
* Duration and frequency of rides
* Speed of gondola and number of holograms per ride + air volume
* Discuss influence of measurement setup
* Height difference, pressure difference
* Detailed description of location
* Position of snowdriftstation and Holfuy station
* Mittelstation 1780m, Bergstation 2280m
* Gondola ride duration ~4 minutes (~2 ½ minutes useable)
* Amount of data: About 600 holograms per ride ~25 GP = 27l
* Gondola speed: ~6m/s
* Height distance: 500m = 45hPa (Exact: 2281-1793m, ~46,5hPa)
* Resolution: 4fps = about one hologram every 50cm
* Fallspeed snow: 1-2m/s 
* Horizontal distance: 830m (Google maps)
* Duration rides: 167, 138, 140, 141, 139, 136, 137, 142, 145
