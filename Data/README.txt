The data provided here was used for the paper "Continuous secondary ice production initiated by updrafts through the melting layer in mountaineous regions" by Lauber et. al 2021, ACP and was collected during the RACLETS field campaign.

The data in "Ceilometer", "Klosters_weather" and "Wind_profiler" is already published on "https://www.envidat.ch/group/raclets-field-campaign". The README files give more specifi information.

Swisstopo data ("DHM25") cannot be provided as it belongs to the Federal Office of Topography but the README file in the folder describes where the data can be found.
The same holds true for wind data from MeteoSwiss in the folder "Wind" that has to be requested from IDAWEB, which is also described in the README file.

For more information on the "Cloudnet" data, we also refer to the README file in the folder.
